# HiddenShell
This is a hidden Linux (Windows is also possible) shell that I made for a little side project. Things I used: rbp0w, kali, nodejs.

# Goal
I wanna make a web backend for a project I call "very VERY mobile kali" (working on a better name XD (same for this web app)).
I want it to be able to be tossed in a network and work XD
I am using a Raspberry pi zero W and the goal of this app is to make it accessible outside the ssh env.
I also want it to be very stealthy, hence the funny looking front-end.

# Features for now
 - Terminal (Linux and Windows compatible)

# Installation
`git clone https://github.com/DeWolfRobin/HiddenShell.git`
`cd HiddenShell`
`npm install`
`npm start`
